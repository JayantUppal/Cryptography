# Cryptography


## Description

A list of encryption algorithms to demonstrate concepts of Cryptography. Programmers and network professionals use cryptography to maintain secure communication and ensure the privacy of computer information.


## What's Included

### [Caesar-Cypher](/Caesar_Cypher.c)

  It is a mono-alphabetic cipher, also known as shift cipher wherein each letter of the plaintext is substituted by another letter to form the ciphertext. It is a     simplest form of substitution cipher scheme.

### [Substitution-Cypher](/Substitution_Cypher.c)
  Simple substitution cipher is the most commonly used cipher and includes an algorithm of substituting every plain text character for every cipher text character. In this process, alphabets are jumbled in comparison with Caesar cipher algorithm. A python script to list out all possibilities while decryption can be found [here](/Sub_Decypher.py).

### [Vignere-Cypher](/Vignere_Cypher.c)
  This cipher uses a text string (say, a word) as a key, which is then used for doing a number of shifts on the plaintext.
